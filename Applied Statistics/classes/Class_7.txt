"### Body Fat [file=bodyfat.txt]#####
Data consists of estimates of the percentage of body fat determined by underwater 
weighing and various body circumference measurements for 252 men. 
The 15 variables are:

Density determined from Hydrostatic Weighing => Percent body fat

13 Predictors (potentially)
Age (years),
Weight (lbs),
Height (inches),
Neck circumference (cm),
Chest circumference (cm),
Abdomen 2 circumference (cm),
Hip circumference (cm),
Thigh circumference (cm),
Knee circumference (cm),
Ankle circumference (cm),
Biceps (extended) circumference (cm),
Forearm circumference (cm),
Wrist circumference (cm).

1) Read these data into R

2) Use the add1(.) and update(.) functions to apply the forward selection method with
p-values and an entry criterion of 0.1

3). Use the drop1(.) and update(.) functions to apply the backward selection method with
p-values and an stay criterion of 0.05

4.) Use the step(.) function to perform forward, backward and stepwise using AIC.

5.) Use the glmnet package to fit the Lasso model to these data.
