"A motor insurance company is conducting an analysis of historic
customer retention data. The response variable is a binary 
indicator of whether that customer renewed their car insurance at
the end of their policy period or did not (1=renewed, 0=did not 
renew). Potential predictors were: the age group of the customer;
the type of cover (comprehensive or third party fire & theft) and
the engine size of the insured vehicle (coded A, B and C in order of 
increasing engine size). 

(a) Read the insurance.csv data into R.

(b) Fit a logistic regression model to these data with retained 
as the reponse variable and age, cover and engine_size as 
predictors. Which predictors are related to the response?

(c) Find the estimated odds ratio that a customer in the 20-29 
age group will renew over a customer in the 50-60 age group - all
other variables being equal.

(d) Discuss the evidence for the predictor ‘cover’ being related
to the response. 

(e) Predict the probability that a customer with the following 
values of the predictors would renew: age= 40-49, cover = 
comprehensive, engine size= A.

(f) State what type of customer the intercept is modelling in 
this case. Calculate the odds that such a customer will renew and
determine a 95% confidence interval for this odds."
