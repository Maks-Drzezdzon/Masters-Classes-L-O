Research is conducted on the effect of two types of antibiotics in treating 
leprosy. For each patient, the volume of leprosy bacillus are recorded from 
six sites on their body both pre-treatment and again post-treatment. Five 
patients  were assigned  to one of two antibiotic treatments (drugs A and D) 
and five  were assigned to a standard drug as a control (drug F). 

The data can be found in the leprosy.csv file on Webcourses.

A model is fitted to these data with post-treatment bacillus volume as the 
response, drug as a categorical predictor, pre-treatment bacilli volume as 
a continuous predictor and the interaction of drug and pre-treatment bacillus 
volume. 

Fit this model and establish if the interaction is required. What is the 
geometric interpretation of this model?

Refit the model without the interaction included. What is the geometric 
interpretation of this revised model? 

Compare the 3 treatments using a general linear hypothesis and the glht() 
function from the multcomp library. Which pairs of treatments (if any) are 
statistically different from each other?
