"### cotton dataset #####
The dataset cotton.csv dataset should be read into R. These data are from a
experiment to relate tensile strength in fabric (lb/in^2, the repsonse) to 
cotton weight by percentage of the fabric (catgprcial response)

(1) Create indicator (dummy variables) for each different cotton_weight value 
in the dataset. Call these dummy15-dummy35. Attempt to fit a regression model 
using the lm funciton with dummy15-dummy35 as the predictors - what do you 
notice? 

(2) Use the anovatab function to get the anova table for the model you fitted.

(3) Use the factor function in the lm() call on the cotton_weight predictor 
and use the anovatab function on this model - compare with your previous 
results - what do you notice?

(4) Interpret the parameter estimates in the two model and compare/contrast 
(use the summary function).

(5) Use the lsmeans library to do a pair-wise comparison of cotton_weights 
using the none, the Bonferroni and FDR correction methods - what are your 
conclusions?

(6) Conduct a GLH using the mutlcomp library to test whether 
weight(30)=weight(35). State the null and alternative hypothesis and your 
conclusions."
