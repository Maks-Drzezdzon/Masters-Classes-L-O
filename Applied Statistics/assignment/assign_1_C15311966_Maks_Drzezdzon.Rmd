Variable Description

=> day 

The day (number code) that observation was recorded.



=> time 

The amount of radiation exposure in minutes the colony was
exposed to in the solar simulator.



=> logcells 

The logarithm (base 2) of the number of live cells in the
colony extrapolated from the sample result under the microscope.

# Background #

Introduction
Researchers in the Radiation and Environmental Science Centre are conducting research into
the effect of solar radiation on the mortality of human skin cells. Colonies of human skin cells
are placed in medium and transferred to wells on experimental plates.

These plates are then exposed to radiation in a solar simulator for various amounts of time from 0 (control) to 3.5
minutes. After exposure, the number of live cells in a sample are counted under a microscope
and the total number of live cells in the colony is extrapolated from the sample result. 

The purpose of this experiment is to assess the effect of the varying times of exposure to radiation
on cell death. Due to inherent variability in the response of cells, the researchers replicate
their experiments a number of times. 

There was also concern that environmental conditions within the lab from day to day may have an impact on the results. Therefore, the experiment is repeated over a number of days. Initially the experiment is designed with complete balance; 

i.e.
the same number of replications at each exposure time on each day. But due to experimental
loss, complete balance was not refected in the fnal data (e.g. some plates were contaminated
and had to be discarded).
